project_5d2247118d5d48d077f0eb42953c5f78,SBIR Phase II: Instrument for Tumor Cell Purging,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project describes a novel laser-based technology for large-scale analysis and processing of living cells. One application of this technology is the detection and elimination of contaminating tumor cells from autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants for cancer patients. Published studies have shown that: (1) contaminating tumor cells contribute to cancer relapse; (2) successful tumor purging provides a clinical benefit; and (3) current purging methods are inadequate. Therefore, technology that reliably eliminates tumor cells from transplants, while leaving HSCs undamaged, is needed. A patented innovative approach integrating fluorescence scanning cytometry, real-time image analysis, and specific laser-induced killing of individual cell targets will be used. The Phase II project will complete the clinical-scale prototype instrument, leading into clinical trials. The instrument design will then be configured for successful commercial manufacturing, and further improvements in capabilities will be pursued in order to maintain market leadership and expand into other markets.<br/><br/>The studies conducted in the Phase II project will lead to commercialization of a method to eliminate detectable tumor cells from an HSC transplant with a several hour automated procedure. The resulting instrumentation will also be useful in a number of other clinical and research applications that require cell analysis and purification with high purity, yield and speed.",
project_3f3904fe8bdacc86f873c242ec3b4de0,Rho GTPase signaling in the developing cerebral cortex,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instnjctions): During cortical development, neuronal progenitors proliferate and then migrate away from the ventricular zone (VZ) to take up residence in the cortical plate (CP). These immature cells take one of two paths upon exiting the VZ: 1) migrating directly along the radial glia scaffold to the CP, taking up residence in an inside out fashion or 2) they migrate to the subventricular zone (SVZ) and take on a multipolar morphology to become intermediate progenitors (IPs), undergo an additional round of cell division before continuing on their way to the CP. Although disruption in these events are known to contribute to pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, the factors regulating progenitor retention in, and release from, unique neurogenic niches are not well understood. Small RhoGTPases, including cdc42 and RhoG, serve as regulators of progenitor proliferation and fate determination within the developing cortex. The mechanisms regulating RhoGTPases particularly in the developing nervous system, are not well understood. These regulators, comprised of GEFs and GAP) control the GTP-loading state, and thus activity, of RhoGTPases. Because GEFs act as activators for RhoGTPase, we hypothesize that GEFs are critical to RhoGTPase-mediated regulation of progenitor proliferation and fate determination in the developing cerebral cortex. We sought to identify GEFs with restricted expression in neurogenic niches of the developing cerebral cortex. Our efforts led us to a small guanine exchange factor (SGEF) whose expression is restricted to the VZ/SVZ during the peak of neurogenesis. SGEF is known to induce formation of F-actin rich protrusions on fibroblasts and endothelial cells (1-2). In support of a role for SGEF in the developing cerebral cortex, mice deficient in SGEF {SGEF^') exhibit reduced neural progenitor proliferation in the SVZ. We will use three aims to test our hypothesis: Aim I: Can altered GEF expression mediate changes in the behavior of immature neurons? Aim II: Do GEFs selectively influence the proliferation and placement of neural progenitors? Aim III: By what mechanism(s) does SGEF regulate the developing cerebral cortex? These studies seek to uncover the mechanism and functional regulation of GEFs in the development of the mammalian cerebral cortex. By focusing on SGEF, whose expression is restricted to a defined neurogenic niche in the developing cerebral cortex and whose deletion appears to have nominal consequences outside of the central nervous system, we are able to use the developing cerebral cortex as a model to uncover clues about how GEFs function to regulate RhoGTPase signaling.

project_40bfc815a3a9120ef5397cbcbef5f5ee,Molecular Basis of GM-CSF-induced Neutrophil Chemotaxis,"The inflammatory process involving neutrophils is critical for host defense and normal healing. However, neutrophils also play a significant role in such pathologic disorders as ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart, emphysema, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. When blood flow is restored after a heart attack, neutrophils can inflict collateral damage on the inflammatory/ischemic reperfusion site and surrounding healthy tissue, because they release powerful lytic enzymes and oxygen radicals. Neutrophils arrive at the target tissue by a process called chemotaxis. The molecular mechanisms leading to chemotaxis in ischemia/reperfusion injury are not well understood. Preliminary data in our laboratory have indicated for the first time that granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that acts as a chemoattractant for neutrophils. GM-CSF-induced chemotaxis seems to involve the activation of the enzyme ribosomal p70S6K kinase (p70S6K). Data from our lab have also indicated that another signaling molecule, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), is active during cell migration and is spatially associated to p70S6K. Finally, we have found that there is a connection between phospholipase D (PLD), chemotaxis and p70S6K activity. This grant focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying neutrophil chemotaxis and the crosstalk between the aforementioned molecules. Our central hypothesis is that GM-CSF-induced neutrophil chemotaxis is mediated by the rapamycin-sensitive p70S6K pathway that, upregulated by MAPK and PLD, acts upon tubulin and actin for enhanced functionality. The Specific Aims will test the following three interrelated hypotheses, by using cellular, molecular and proteomic techniques: 1-. MAPK is an upstream regulator of S6K-induced chemotaxis in GM-CSF-stimulated neutrophils. The goal is to test if an interaction between the MAPK and p70S6K pathways, involving covalent modification by phosphorylation, leads to chemotaxis. 2-. There is a molecular crosstalk between PLD and S6K in GM-CSF-stimulated neutrophil chemotaxis. The goal is to test if PLD (PLD 1/2), and at what level (upstream or downstream), is involved in the mechanism of p70S6K activation and subsequent functional chemotaxis. 3. Alternate mechanisms of rapamycin action exist for the inhibition of GM-CSF-induced chemotaxis. The goal is to test which of the following is inhibited by rapamycin: the signaling molecules TOR (target of rapamycin) and p70S6K; nascent protein translation; or the actuator molecules actin and tubulin. Given the devastating effects inflicted by neutrophils during reperfusion, it is reasonable to act on the first event: chemotaxis. This proposal will advance our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern cell movement. Inhibitors can then be designed to prevent leukocyte-mediated tissue injury that occurs during ischemia/reperfusion and in similar host-damaging inflammation pathologies.",
project_130212c1c36685349c6e3be06ab8da42,Development Of Gamma Ray Detection Array For Tagget Photon Experiments,"Research has been conducted towards the development of orrays of detectors for the observation of high energy gamma-rays produced in tagged photon induced nuclear reactions.Initial work was directed towards investigating possible materials for use in detecting high energy gamma-rays. However, it was latter decided to develop a combined pion proton detector (PIP). The detector comprises a Delta E layer and 4 E layers. The Delta E layer is made up of 4 1 mm sheets of plastic scintillator mounted vertically and viewed by fantail light guides at each end. Vertical position measurements of entrant particles are made by recording time differences from the signals observed at each end. The 4 E layers are made of 19 substantial blocks with thicknesses up to 17.5 cm each. A total thickness of 68 cm is achieved which is capable of stopping 180 MeV plons and 400 MeV protons. Horizontal position measurements are again achieved using time difference signals from each end of the blocks.The detector has been tested using a large neutron time of flight array and signals are compared to simulated data. Results are encouraging and it can be concluded that PIP is virtually complete and works well.A prototype was made available on 14/10/92",
